# Nepenthe

She was burried in the Urgathoa temple. She was awakened from the dead. We are not sure how.
She was the wife of a [[Notes/Characters/High society/Tobias Highridge\|Tobias Highridge]]. She was killed by [[Notes/Characters/Others/Sahni the Bride of the sea\|Sahni the Bride of the sea]] but somehow came back.
She was a night hag.

She was brought back and went out north from the temple.
