# 11.05.25

Leeches are coming out of a glass jar. 
# Combat
We attack the [[Notes/Beastiary/Swarm of leeches\|Swarm of leeches]]. 
Then an [[Notes/Beastiary/aquatic-ooze\|aquatic-ooze]] comes out of a chest. 

Ha'Chuew is in a bad position:

Poe is struggling to move. Ven ends up pushing him.
A [[Notes/Beastiary/Mandrake\|Mandrake]] comes out of nowhere and lets out a shriek. Everyone is sickened just to different levels.
 Ha'Chuew takes a lot of damage but survives because orc. 
We take the swarm out and then Humdinger scares the mandrake. We finish off the ooze.

# Exploration
 Found a small box with the journal of the hag. -> Humdinger takes it. 
 Found some elixirs. Winter wolf, Elixir of life and Antidote against poison.
There's magic from the hag's eye. We took the eye and lots of healing.

There was a magical cauldron that "dismantles" stuff. Like if you put a chest in there, it would turn into wood pieces and metal ingots.

In the bedroom we found various gems.

We try to got through the north door but there is this dude named Blandlow (?).

He said he was here on a pilgrimage and that a "nice lady" would often give him food.
Humdinger tried to get him to go away by pretending that there was another temple with free fish further away. But the dude wouldn't move no matter what.  He was in front of the statue we wanted to destroy. 

Poe started swimming away to blast this statue from afar but Bob just punched it really hard. Done with that, the quest [[Notes/Sessions/02.05.25#Quest Dagon temple\|02.05.25#Quest Dagon temple]].  #DoneQuest

# Combat
Combat with [[Notes/Beastiary/Wight\|Wight]] .
Ven cast "calm" which ended the combat peacefully.
# End combat

They explained us some things: Apparently the previous hag [[Notes/Characters/High society/Nepenthe\|Nepenthe]] is not dead. She left north of the temple.
When we looked into the crypt, we found the diamond ring (Wedding ring that [[Notes/Characters/High society/Tobias Highridge\|Tobias Highridge]] wanted) that seems to have been left there on purpose. 

We gave it back to him. He is confused as to why she hasn't come back to him after being brought back. 
He gave us a [[Notes/Items/necklace of fireball\|necklace of fireball]]. #MagicalItem 
We checked the eye: [[Notes/Items/Stoney hag eye\|Stoney hag eye]]. #MagicalItem
It pertrifies stuff. Normally you would have to take one of your eyes out but Humdinger has no eyes to take out, so chill. He "attunes" to it
